     - [ ] GET /research-tasks/{id}/operations - All operations for a task
     - [ ] GET /research-tasks/{id}/evidence - All evidence for a task
     - [ ] GET /research-tasks/{id}/report - Generated research report
   - [ ] Test all API endpoints return complete data
   - [ ] Add any missing endpoints for UI data access

3. **Essential UI Data Display**
   - [ ] Expand task list to show: ID, title, status, query, created time
   - [ ] Add task detail view showing:
     - [ ] Basic task information (title, query, status, timestamps)
     - [ ] Topic decomposition results (if available)
     - [ ] List of executed search agents/providers
     - [ ] Generated research report content
   - [ ] Add operations timeline showing:
     - [ ] Each research step (decomposition, planning, execution, synthesis)
     - [ ] Which MCP providers were used
     - [ ] Start/end times and status for each operation
   - [ ] Add evidence detail view showing:
     - [ ] LLM prompts and responses
     - [ ] Search queries and results
     - [ ] Raw MCP tool call data

4. **POC Validation & Testing**
   - [ ] Verify all database data is visible in UI
   - [ ] Test with real research task to ensure complete data flow
   - [ ] Validate that UI shows meaningful research workflow information
   - [ ] Ensure UI updates reflect actual backend processing

**OUT OF SCOPE for Phase 3 (deferred to later phases):**
- Report export functionality (PDF, DOCX)
- Estimated completion times
- Operation retry mechanisms
- Advanced formatting and styling
- Performance metrics dashboards
