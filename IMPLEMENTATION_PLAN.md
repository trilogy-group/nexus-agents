## Next Steps (Updated Priority)

### CRITICAL PATH: PostgreSQL Migration
**Background**: DuckDB concurrency limitations have been identified as a blocking issue for multi-agent operation. The system currently cannot support concurrent database access required for multiple agents, workers, and API operations.

**Immediate Priorities**:
1. **Setup PostgreSQL Infrastructure** (Phase 2A)
   - Add Docker Compose service for local PostgreSQL
   - Configure connection settings and environment variables
   - Install asyncpg or SQLAlchemy async driver

2. **Schema Translation** (Phase 2B)
   - Extract current DuckDB schema from KnowledgeBase class
   - Create equivalent PostgreSQL DDL with proper constraints
   - Add performance indexes for concurrent operations

3. **Core Code Migration** (Phase 2C)
   - Refactor KnowledgeBase class for PostgreSQL
   - Update API server for persistent PG connections
   - Update worker for persistent PG connections
   - Enable proper connection pooling

4. **Testing & Validation** (Phase 2D)
   - Test concurrent agent operations
   - Verify evidence tracking with multiple processes
   - Performance testing under load

5. **Cleanup & Documentation** (Phase 2E)
   - Remove DuckDB dependencies
   - Update setup and deployment docs

### Secondary Priorities (After PG Migration)
1. Complete remaining MCP integrations
2. Enhance error handling and resilience
3. Performance optimization and monitoring
4. Production deployment preparation
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
